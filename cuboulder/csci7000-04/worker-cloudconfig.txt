#cloud-config
#mbb-instance: cloud-init configuration file:
#You need to craft a cloud-config.txt file that does the following:

#2. Installs zookeeper
#3. Installs protobuf-compiler
#4. Installs python-pip
#5. Installs git-core
#6. Suppresses upgrades and updates for all other packages (takes a long time)
#7. Run’s “pip” to install the “pika” package
#8. Installs an SSH keypair (any) into your virtual machine root account

#You also need to create a “user data” script that creates a directory “/tmp/data-scale”.
#You then need to create a “multi-part MIME” file that combines both the cloud-config.txt file and your user-data.sh file.
#Your example should be functional – you should try it out by running an OpenStack instance using the previously mentioned AMI image. 
#You’ll probably need to do this a few times because the debugging info provided by cloud-init isn’t that good. 
#You should focus on launch “small” instances because they launch quicker – your example would function the same on other instances too.

# Update apt database on first boot
# (ie run apt-get update)
#
# Default: true
#
apt_update: false

# Upgrade the instance on first boot
# (ie run apt-get upgrade)
#
# Default: false
#
apt_upgrade: false

# Install additional packages on first boot
#
# Default: none
#
# if packages are specified, this apt_update will be set to true
#
packages:
 - rabbitmq-server
 - zookeeper
 - protobuf-compiler
 - python-pip
 - git-core

ssh_import_id: [id_rsa]

# run commands
# default: none
# runcmd contains a list of either lists or a string
# each item will be executed in order at rc.local like level with
# output to the console
# - if the item is a list, the items will be properly executed as if
#   passed to execve(3) (with the first arg as the command).
# - if the item is a string, it will be simply written to the file and
#   will be interpreted by 'sh'
#
# Note, that the list has to be proper yaml, so you have to escape
# any characters yaml would eat (':' can be problematic)
runcmd:
 - [ sh, -c, echo "=========hello world'=========" ]
 - pip install pika
